# Shell Box: My code and notes of learning Linux shells (mainly POSIX)

## Overview

This repository contains my code and notes of learning Linux shells, e.g., `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`. I mainly want to learn **POSIX behaviors** (see the reference [1]), but because `bash` is very popular and it has more additional features that a POSIX shell may not have, I also want to learn it. Lastly, sometimes I also need to use `zsh`, so I'll learn it whenever possible.
